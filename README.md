# Description:
 An 8-bit retro style video game that we developed from September 2021 to June 2022.
 As part of our junior team project, we created this game out of our curiosity in 
 game development. It encompasses a comedic story with some darker dungeon fighting
 elements. The dungeons are created as mazes to make the player work towards their
 ultimate goal of finding their brother who ate their pie.
